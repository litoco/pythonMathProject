# pythonMathProject

This python project is made in python3.

In this project I tried to make a words to number and number to word converter. 

The number to words converter project changes the given number into its corresponding word representation. 


Eg:
If 101 is provided as input the corresponding output(without quotes) is "one hundred one".

The words to number works exactly opposite of number to word, it converts the given word into its corresponding numerical format. 

Eg:
If "one hundred eleven" is provided as an input(without quotes)  it outputs 111.

I have made this project in my second year. I have used very simple logic for this conversion. It only uses functions and lists concepts.

This was just a fun project that can be used for kids to show the encourage them to learn in a more fun way.
